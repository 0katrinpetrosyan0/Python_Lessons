# 2. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.

name = input("name: ")
last = input("lastname: ")

print(last + " " + name)


# reverse the words , too
# x = input("name + lastname: ")
# print(x[::-1])  

#reverse 2 words from one input
# name = str(input("Enter your name and lastname")).split(' ')
# z = name.reverse()
# for i in range(len(name)):
#     print(name[i], end=" ")
